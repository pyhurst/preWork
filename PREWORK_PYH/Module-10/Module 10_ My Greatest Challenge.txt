Module 10: My Greatest Challenge


        My greatest challenge out of the 10 keys to success will be trying to stay patient throughout the process.  I know that it will take time to become a skilled developer but I normally have a pretty high standard for myself.  I feel that I should understand new concepts the first time around or very quickly.  I need to keep in mind that this might not be realistic when it comes to the more difficult concepts and techniques.
